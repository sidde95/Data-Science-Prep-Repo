# What is Data Science?

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that involves extracting knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data through various process, techniques, and algorithms. It combines elements from statistics, mathematics, computer science and domain knowledge to analyse and interpret data and make informed decisions.

Data Science Encompasses a wide range of activities, including data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, explanatory data analysis, data visualisation, statistical modelling, machine learning and predictive analytics.

Data Scientists utilize programming language like Python or R, along with tools and libraries specifically designed for data analysis and machine learning, to work with large datasets and develop models and algorithms to train models that can make predictions or uncover hidden patterns in the data.

Data Science has application in numerous industries and domains, including finance, healthcare, marketing, e-commerce, social media and more. It plays a crucial role in helping business and organizations leverage their data to gain a competitive advantage, improve operational efficiency, optimize processes and drive innovation.

Overall, data scsience is a field that leverages data and analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights and valueable knowledge, enabling business and organizations to make data-informed decisions andsolve complex problems.

# Difference between Data Analyst vs Business Analyst vs Machine Learning Engineer vs Data Scientist vs Artificial Intelligence(AI).

1. **Data Analyst**:
> - Data Analyst focus on gathering, analyzing and interpreting data to identify trends, patterms and insights.
> - They use statistical techniques and tools to clean, organize and visualize data.
> - Data Analysts often work with structured data and help business make data-driven decisions and solve specific problems.

2. **Business Analyst**:
> - Business analyst bridge the gap between business goals and technology solutions.
> - They analyze business process, idenitfy areas for improvement and propose strategies to enchance efficiency and productivity.
> Business analysts work closely with stakeholders, gather requirements and facilitate communication between business units and technical teams.

3. **Machine Learning**:
